## Covid-19 Results Predicition

This is a machine learning model to predict the chances of corona positive or negative for future test takers based only on the diagnosis of their symptoms. 
I have received good accuracy results from 3 models and these can be choosen for deployment. 
I have done all steps necessary for building a robust and generalized model including Data cleaning, Exploration of dataset, Data Analysis,  Selecting/Deleting needed features, Feature Engineering, Feature balancing and selection, Model building and Hyperparameter tuning.
